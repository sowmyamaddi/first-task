Both his characters were done justice, and he reminded of his father at many places."[15] Magadheera grossed over ₹150 crores worldwide and held the record of being the highest-grossing Telugu film until 2013 before it was surpassed by Attarintiki Daredi.[16] The film received six Filmfare Awards including two awards – Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and Nandi Special Jury Award for Charan</p>

The Central Board of Film Certification gave the film an 'A' certificate because of its violent action sequences.[43] Bangalore Mirror wrote that "For Ram Charan, Yevadu is essential to establish his status after Thoofan tanked at the box office. His character has two shades, and he tries his best to bring variations. He dances like there is no tomorrow and the choreography is a delight to watch."[44] A critic of Sify compared Charan's performance to his earlier films – Nayak and Thoofan and commented that he has done a fairly good job here.[45] Y.
